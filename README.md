Torch Tornado Tools
-------------------

There is a collection of tools that make life a little easier when working with Tornado, some of these 
should get integrated over time.  Some will stay outside of Tornado, but the goal is to have a nice set
of client libraries that are useable by a Tornado application.  

Most everything is forcused on Networking stack stuff.

  * Redis - client and subscription client
  * WebSockets - client
  * SMTP - Send Mail
